          <h3>Ryan steps away from the Node project 👨‍💻</h3>
          <p> Ryan Dahl gave the following reason for moving on from the project: <em>"After three years of working on Node, this frees me up to work on research projects. I am still an employee at Joyent and will advise from the sidelines but I won’t be involved in the day-to-day bug fixes." </em></p>

          <h3>Deno 🦕</h3>
          <p>Is his new JavaScript/TypeScript runtime built with V8. Some of its benefits are improved security, better performance and more. Which of his two great inventions will take advantage? Only time will show us..</p>
